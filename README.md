## Chat App with Socket.io

A very tiny project made with [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) + [Express](http://expressjs.com) + [React](https://reactjs.org) that can create and join rooms and chat with everybody inside the room.

The app is up [here](https://pacific-cliffs-67186.herokuapp.com)

## Implementation

I did this project within 4 days to learn how to use [socket.io](https://socket.io) with [React](https://reactjs.org) and deploy to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com). 
The code quality is messy, so don't judge me :relaxed: .

## How to build

Clone the repo on a directory. On the Express root, run `npm install`. Then enter the `client` directory from React and , again, run `npm install`.

### Running the server

Run `npm start` on Express directory to start the API. run `npm start` on client directory, from React, to run the frontend.

## About This Project

This was an experimental app, but i really liked it and want to make this a real useful app. This implementation will be fully changed because all is messy and i was learning, so hope for the best :heart:

Thanks for take the time to read!
